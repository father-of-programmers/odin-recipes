    <p>
        Neapolitan pizza is a traditional Italian dish renowned for 
        its simplicity and high-quality ingredients. Originating 
        from Naples, this pizza features a soft, chewy crust that is 
        charred to perfection in a wood-fired oven. The dough is made 
        from just flour, water, salt, and yeast, resulting in a light 
        and airy base.

        Topped with San Marzano tomatoes, fresh mozzarella di bufala, 
        and fragrant basil, Neapolitan pizza highlights the natural 
        flavors of its ingredients. The combination of the sweet tomatoes, 
        creamy cheese, and aromatic basil creates a harmonious balance that 
        delights the palate. Typically cooked at high temperatures for a 
        short duration, the pizza has a slightly crisp edge while remaining 
        soft and pliable in the center, making it perfect for folding.

        Steps
    </h2>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Mix all the ingredients into a shaggy mass in a large bowl,
            starting by adding the water first. You can do this by hand
            or use a wooden spoon.
        </li>
        <li>
            Cover the bowl with cling film, a plastic carrier bag, or 
            a damp cloth (if the cloth isn't damp the dough may dry out).
        </li>
        <li>
            Leave the dough to rest for around 1 hour (the technical term
             for this process is the Autolyse).

            If you've come this far I pity you for being gullible enough to
            think that this was gonna be something serious. Just leave. What
            am I? Gordon Ramsay? Go learn cooking from a legitimate chef!
