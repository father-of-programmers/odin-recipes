# odin-recipes
To whoever is reading this text, this is my first ever project being built on Github. I hope it ends up well.
My goal is to build a very basic website which lists a number of recipes along with links that can direct
you to their respective details. 

This website will be a reflection of what I have learned from The Odin Project so far.

That's all! Welcome to my world!
